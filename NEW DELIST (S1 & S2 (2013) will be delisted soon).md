If you ask a Sonic fan what their favorite version of Sonic 1 or 2 is, some may say the Sonic Jam versions, others may say the Mega Collection version. But most will probably say the 2013 Mobile Ports.

Released in 2013 (or 2011 for CD), these ports were created by Christian Whitehead, who was originally a fangame developer for the franchise, using his Retro Engine.

Whitehead had initially created Retro Engine for his fangame Retro Sonic, being a near 1:1 recreation of the engine used in the Genesis era of Sonic games. In 2009, SEGA needed ideas for a Sonic CD port to iOS. Whitehead came forth showing CD running natively on the phone with his Retro Engine. SEGA had decided to work with him and released the CD port in 2011, which was also later ported to Steam, Xbox 360, and PS3. Whitehead's ports were so well received that him and HeadCannon would be commissioned to make the 2013 ports. The best part about these versions is that they were free, so no one had to pay anything to play them.

Originally, these ports were locked behind mobile devices and couldn't be played on PC without Android emulation. But in the start of 2021, that all changed when RubberDuckyCooly decompiled both RSDKv3 (CD) and RSDKv4 (1 and 2) so they could be played natively on PC, just a year before Origins released. As long as you owned the mobile versions, you could play Sonic CD, 1, and 2 natively on your PC for free. In that same year, Team Forever released Sonic 1 Forever and Sonic 2 Absolute, which are enhanced versions of Christian Whitehead's ports that build off of the decompilations. Which, again, as long as you owned the mobile versions, you could play Sonic 1 and 2 natively on your PC for free.

However, in late 2025, and soon to be somewhere in 2026, Sonic CD, 1 and 2 are (or have in CD's case) being delisted from the App and Play Store. While the decompilations has gained support for the Origins version, Sonic 1 Forever and Sonic 2 Absolute haven't, and with these versions being delisted soon, it will make them impossible to play. That's what this archive is for, to remain as a way to download these versions even after the delist. This site also works as a way to get the data.rsdk files for the decomp or Team Forever's projects for iOS users who aren't willing to jailbreak their phones to obtain it.
